# xlr8: Quickly Create Consistently Styled Excel Reports from R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**`xlr8`** simplifies and accelerates the process of generating consistently styled Excel reports directly from R. It uses metadata tags embedded within Excel templates to automatically place your data and preserve formattingâ€”making Excel reporting fast, easy, and repeatable.

**With `xlr8` you can:**

- Read structured metadata from Excel templates.
- Automatically populate Excel templates with R data.
- Effortlessly apply original Excel styles and formatting.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `xlr8` directly from GitHub using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("your_github_username/xlr8")
```

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of how `xlr8` streamlines Excel report creation:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(xlr8)

# Your data frame with report data
df <- tibble::tibble(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  score = c(95, 82, 87)
)

# Generate a formatted Excel report
xlr8(
  df = df,
  metadata_path = "templates/student_scores_template.xlsx",
  output_path = "reports/student_scores_report.xlsx"
)
```

After running this code, you'll have a fully formatted Excel file ready to share or distribute:

## Why `xlr8`?

- **Consistency**: Keep your Excel reports visually consistent with minimal effort.
- **Automation**: Reduce manual copying, pasting, and formatting.
- **Flexibility**: Easily modify your templates without changing R code.

## How does it work?

`xlr8` uses embedded metadata tags in your Excel template to identify where data should be placed and how it should be styled. It then applies these styles automatically after populating data, ensuring your final report always matches your predefined formatting.
